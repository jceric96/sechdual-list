## Description of Changes Made to Folders/Files
In index.php, I added "ajax script" in order to send user input and receive data list, and added "if loop" to jump to login.php before log-in. I created header.php and footer.php in order to re-use header and footer codes in login.php. I modified processform.php in order to insert users' inputs into database, delete items from database, and update users' itemlist to database. I modified login.php in order to let users check/update their itemlist when they login successfully or will give login error information. I created logout.php in order to destory the session. I modified main.css in order to show the great interface.
